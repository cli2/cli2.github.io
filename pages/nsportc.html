            <p class="">
                There is over <b>380,000</b> sports-related concussions in the US.
                Unlike professional sports teams, middle school or high school teams don’t often have medical professional on the team,
                so coaches are the front line to make the right judgement if an incident happens.
                Also, even if the incident doesn’t lead to a concussion, all pre-medical information should be recorded because they are very important to doctors.
            </p>

      <p>
        As a group of 6 designers, we started our 3-month research-based design process to build a product to help high-school team coaches make right decisions and keep all pre-medical data when a player gets hit.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked as the lead designer for web interface. I also participated in the design of mobile app, the user research, and usability tests.

        <h1 class="center">The Research</h1>
        <p>
          In order to know more about our users, sports concussion scenarios, and if there is any related regulations,
          we kicked off our research and discovered valuable insights.
        </p>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>
          <b>- User Interviews</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            We conducted interviews to understand what coaches really need.
            We talked with two coaches, Joe and Max, who have been high school coaches for over 10 years,
            Interestingly, they both also have children who played in high school teams,
            so they also shared their experience as parents. Here is the major findings:
          <ul>
            <li>Coaches can hardly tell if a player is in suspicious of having a concussion after being hit.</li>
            <li>Although state laws regulates that coaches go through a concussion training, only a few can remember the details of the training.</li>
            <li>Parents think the pre-medical records are important even if the incident does not lead to concussion.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <div class="clearfix">
          <br>
          <p>
            <b>- Personas</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            We built two primary personas for coaches and one secondary persona for parents based on our interviews.
            Coaches vary by their coaching experience.
            A more experienced coach have more awareness of each player's health status,
            while a less experienced coach may miss some important health indicators.

              Parents care about children's health as well as how they recover from the concussion.
              In addition, they play an important role in helping recording children's recovery.

            <p>
              Since concussion is crucial to brain health, which is a serious issue,
              we started to look into some federal regulations that might influence our product.
              In our research, we find two major legal regulations:
                <ul>
                    <li>A player who is believed to have concussion should be removed from the play immediately.</li>
                    <li>Only medical professionals should determine whether a teenager player has concussion.</li>
                    <li>A player can only return to play with permission from a health care professional.</li>

          <h2>Assessment Tools Research</h2>
          <p>
              Now that we know coaches need assistance in assessing if a play is in concussion or not, we looked into various assessment tools and their pros &amps; cons:
              <ul>
                <li>Sideline Concussion Assessment Tool, version 3 (SCAT3): accurate but requires professional medical help</li>
                <li>King-Devick Test: requires eye-movement detector</li>
                <li>Balance Error Scoring System (BESS): requires a long test test</li>
                <li>Wearables: expensive to purchase</li>
                <li>5-min assessment: quick and easy to implement, with 90% accuracy</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>- Insights</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            After comparing the different tools and talking with coaches,
            we decided to adopt the 5-min assessment tool and build it into our product.

            Based on our research and product explorations,
            we defined our product as a duo-platform application to help school coaches make right decisions and work with parents to keep all pre-medical data when a player gets hit.
            There are three main functionalities: Team Management; Concussion Assessment; Player Medical Records.

          <p>
            We found that most coaches have a smartphone and carry it with them on court.
            They also often have computers in their office. Therefore, We decided to put the more sophisticated team management tools on the web platform,
            while the mobile app covers the assessment tool.
          </p>
        <p>
            We created workflow diagrams to visualize the end-to-end user experience and map the product workflow.
            On the web, coaches and parents will follow a simple registration process and land on a customized dashboard.

                    the mobile app will determine whether the test is passed or failed.
                    If the test is failed, our product will advice the coach to immediately send the player to medical professionals for further diagnosis.

         After finishing the prototype, we did two usability tests and fixed some usability problems.
         For example, on our first version, we use the alphabetical order for the player list.
         But we later changed it to order by status to better group the information.

          <i>Group players by status</i>

        Also from coach feedback, teenage player may look similar on small profile pictures.
        So in order identify players, we added names identify each player.

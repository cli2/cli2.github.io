        <p class="text">
            NSportC is a combination of web and mobile app that helps middle school and high school coaches handle potential concussions in the right way. Furthermore, NSportC will also help teenager sports players and their parents keep pre-medical information.

        <h1 class="center">The Problem - 'In Suspicion' of Concussion</h1>
        <p class="text">
            In high school sports teams, players can easily fall down and might get concussion. However, how to tell <b>if a player is still healthy to play or is in suspicion of concussion</b> is very hard for high school coaches since there is no professional
            medical teams in high school. In addition, it is hard to manage player's physical conditions and previous concussion records. Therefore, NSportC is very helpful in handling these conditions.
        </p>

            However, in our research, we find two major <b>legal regulations</b>:
            <ul class="padding">
                <li>If a teenager player is in suspicion of having concussion, the coach should remove the player from play immediately.</li>
                <li>Only medical professionals should determine whether a teenager player has concussion.</li>

            <h1>User Interviews</h1>
            <p>
                We kicked off the user research right after the research. To confirm our assumption, we interviewed with two coaches, Joe and Max. Both of them have been high school coaches for over 10 years, and they have children that play in high school teams. From
                our user interviews, we confirmed our assumption and realized that our product could potentially help both coaches and players' parents.

            <li>Parents think the pre-medical records are important even if the incident does not lead to concussion, because they believe that the <b>real problem is the overall brain health</b>, not how many concussions happened in the past.</li>

            <h1>Primary Personas</h1>
            <p>
                After interviewing with coaches, we decided to design two persona types - primary persona for middle school or high school coaches and secondary persona for teenager players' parents.<br><br> For our primary persona type, we developed
                two personas varying by their coaching experience. This variable could greatly affect the behavior and experience using our product. A more experienced coach may have more awareness of each player's health status, while a less experienced
                coach may miss important indicators that a player's health status is unstable.

    <p class="text">
        We researched on concussion training materials and asked opinions from experienced coaches. To determine the mental state of a teenager player and the possibility of concussion, coaches normal ask three types of questions to the players when an incident
        happens:
        <ul class="padding">
            <li>Basic questions related to the player's demographical information. For example, "what is your mother's name?" and "what grade are you in?"</li>
            <li>Cognitive questions to test the logical thinking of the player. For example, "can you repeat reversely of the numbers listed here?" and "can you tell me what is 3 times 5 minus 6?"</li>
            <li>Motional tasks to see if the player can control the body balance. For example, "on a firm surface, stand on single foot" and "one foot behind other".</li>

                with the test. The coach will also be able to quickly switch teams via the sidebar and view players' status and information.

            <p class="text">
                In high school sports teams, players can easily fall down and might get concussion. However, how to tell <b>if a player is still healthy to play or is in suspicion of concussion</b> is very hard for high school coaches since there is no
                professional medical teams in high school. In addition, it is hard to manage player's physical conditions and previous concussion records. Therefore, NSportC is very helpful in handling these conditions.

                <ul class="padding">
                    <li>If a teenager player is in suspicion of having concussion, the coach should remove the player from play immediately.</li>

                    To find what parents and coaches need when dealing with potential concussions, we interviewed with two coaches, Joe and Max. Both of them have been high school coaches for over 10 years, and they have children that play in high school teams.

                          <li>Parents think the pre-medical records are important even if the incident does not lead to concussion, because they believe that the <b>real problem is the overall brain health</b>, not how many concussions happened in the past.</li>

                <p>
                    For our primary persona type, we developed two personas varying by their coaching experience. A more experienced coach may have more awareness of each player's health status, while a less experienced coach may miss important indicators that a player's
                    health status is unstable, which is the reason for <b>adding the team management function</b>. On the other hand, both types <b>need a standardized assessment tool</b> to tell if a player is still healthy.

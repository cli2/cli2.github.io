            <p>
                In summer 2017, I interned at Adobe's headquater in San Jose, California as a UX Designer on the Business Operations &amp; Planning team.
                I was working on the product design of Adobe PPM 2.0 (Project Portfolio Management) where everyone at Adobe can access projects, align with corporate strategy, manage portfolio, and work as One Adobe.
                <br><br>
                In the 12 weeks, I worked with PMs, software engineers, and design mentors to create seamless and meaningful user experience to accelerate the reporting and strategic planning across Adobe.

            <p>
              The Adobe PPM 1.0 was built several years ago upon several different applications.
              Adobe has evolved a lot since then, making most of the functionalities in Adobe PPM 1.0 redundant and outdated.
              Adobe employees are hoping for a better management application that helps them manage projects and align with company strategy.

            <p class="">
              After analyzing surveys, interview data, and conducting heuristic evaluation on current application, I worked with the product manager and my team to identify the key issues of Adobe PPM 1.0:
              <ul style="column-count:2; list-style-position: inside;">
                <li>Lack of visibility across different BUs</li>

                <li>Burdensome workflow</li>

                <li>Heavy reporting procedures</li>

        <p>
          My team had conducted preliminary research by interviewing and surveying users across different positions.
          Based on our research insights, I created four personas.
          Each persona will have different view, task, and access.
          <br><br>
          Based on the different tasks of each persona, I built the user workflow to demonstrate how they will use Adobe PPM 2.0 to achieve their goals.

          I also constructed the sitemap (information architecture) by analyzing the existing architecture and future vision.
          The new PPM will keep only the essential functions and be accessible on both web and mobile(not in scope).

        <h1 class="center">Design Iterations</h1>
        <p>
          As the only designer in the team, I worked through 6 rounds of design iterations to get to the final mockups and prototype.
          Adobe PPM 2.0 covers the primary functions of reporting, project recording, strategy alignment, portfolio management.
          It also provides an intuitive dashboard which presents the key information and project changes, as well as smart notifications that help simplify the workflow.
        </p>
        <div class="clearfix">
          <h2>Iteration 1</h2>
          <p>
            Starting from "scratch", I first distilled the most important information sections and rephrased them in to different pods that enable flexibility on different screen sizes.
            I also designed a dashboard that consists of succinct data from different tabs.
          </p>
          <img src="image/adobe/i1.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div class="clearfix">
          <h2>Iteration 2</h2>
          <p>
            However, the information presentation in iteration 1 is still to overwhelming and patterns used are not consistent.
            So the second iteration focused on understanding what is really important to users and only keep the relevant data on the dashboard and front page.
            In addition, I also explored the interaction patterns used in table design such as 'drawers', 'modal screen', and 'breadcrums'.
          </p>
          <img src="image/adobe/i2.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div class="clearfix">
          <h2>Iteration 3</h2>
          <p>
            Continueing with iteration 2, this iteration dealt with designing forms and the interface for editing forms.
            I iterated through different layout by experimenting with margins, font size, paddings, and button positions.
            In addition, I also learnt how to choose button styles more wisely (e.g. using CTA buttons only once for proceeding to next steps, group action buttons together as a toolbar).

          <img src="image/adobe/i3.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div class="clearfix">
          <h2>Iteration 4</h2>
          <p>
            In this iteration, I looked at tables again to explore the four key aspects:
            <ul>
              <li>How to present data given a limited table width</li>
              <li>How to arrange columns and decide which comes first</li>
              <li>How to filter the data to enable customization</li>
              <li>How to design editing functionality inside a table</li>
            </ul>

          <img src="image/adobe/i4.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div class="clearfix">
          <h2>Iteration 5</h2>
          <p>
            In iteration 5, I started to look at the 'automated workflow' and how the interface would look like for different personas.
            I created a user workflow cycle engaging all three primary personas and bridged the gap between them by designing micro-interactions like useful feedback and smart notifications.

        <div class="clearfix">
          <h2>Iteration 6</h2>
          <p>
            This is the last round during my internship. I refined the icon styles, unified margins/paddings, adjusted color palette to create pixel-perfect hi-fidelity mockups.
            I also created a working prototype to help my team present the new solution to stakeholders.

            <p>
                In summer 2017, I interned at Adobe's headquater in San Jose, California as a UX Designer on the Business Operations &amp; Planning team.
                I was working on the product design of Adobe PPM 2.0 (Project Portfolio Management) where everyone at Adobe can access projects, align with corporate strategy, manage portfolio, and work as One Adobe.
                <br><br>
                In the 12 weeks, I worked with PMs, software engineers, and design mentors to create seamless and meaningful user experience to accelerate the reporting and strategic planning across Adobe.
                <br><br>
                <i>
                  * Due to NDA, I only showcase my design process and several mock-ups that contain no confidential information on this page.

            <p>
              The Adobe PPM (Project Portfolio Management) 1.0 was built several years ago upon several different applications.
              Adobe has evolved a lot since then, making most of the functionalities in Adobe PPM 1.0 redundant and outdated.
              The UI looks like from 1990s and the backend data fetching is slow. Different BUs are using different project management tools and people often need to jump back and forth to oversee projects.
            </p>
            <img src="image/adobe/current.png" alt="" />
            <p class="center">
              <i>Outdated UI of Adobe PPM 1.0</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              This is why Adobe PPM 2.0 is brought up by our team to accelerate the process and help Adobe employees manage projects and align with company strategy.
              Our team is also hoping that Adobe PPM 2.0 can become the 'single source of truth' at Adobe to help us win in the marketplace.

            <p>
              As the only designer on the team, I worked closely with PMs to dig user needs and define the 2.0. I also met with my design mentor every week to critique and iterate the design.

            <p>
              My team has conducted extensive competitive analysis and user research such as surveys and interviews before my internship.
              So my primary research task focused on synthesizing the research data and distilling key insights.

            </p>
            <h2>Understanding Users</h2>
            <p>
              The primary users of Adobe PPM 2.0 will be the product managers, program managers, and vice presidents at Adobe.
              In order to illustrate our users and their goals, I created three primary personas based on the user research - the project initiators who create projects, the project managers who manage and report projects, and the executives who approve projects and align to company strategy.

            <h2>Identifying Key Issues</h2>
            <p class="">
              After analyzing surveys, interview data, and conducting heuristic evaluation on current application, I worked with the product manager and my team to identify the key issues of Adobe PPM 1.0:
              <ul style="column-count:2; list-style-position: inside;">
                <li>Lack of visibility across different BUs</li>
                <li>No single source of truth</li>
                <li>Burdensome workflow</li>
                <li>Outdated user interface</li>
                <li>Heavy reporting procedures</li>
                <li>Bad user experience</li>

        <p>
          My team had conducted preliminary research by interviewing and surveying users across different positions.
          Based on our research insights, I created four personas.
          Each persona will have different view, task, and access.
          <br><br>
          Based on the different tasks of each persona, I built the user workflow to demonstrate how they will use Adobe PPM 2.0 to achieve their goals.

          I also constructed the sitemap (information architecture) by analyzing the existing architecture and future vision.
          The new PPM will keep only the essential functions and be accessible on both web and mobile(not in scope).

        <p>
          The Adobe PPM 2.0 consists of an all new dashboard, project management, portfolio prioritization, reporting, and admistration functionalities.
          With the new dashboard, users can get the most important updates and sending updates within one click.
          With the automated workflow, the system guides users to manage projects and prioritize portfolio step by step.
          With smart notifications and groups, collaboration becomes easy and intuitive.

        <h1 class="center">Design Iterations</h1>
        <p>
          As the only designer in the team, I worked through 6 rounds of design iterations to get to the final mockups and prototype.
          Adobe PPM 2.0 covers the primary functions of reporting, project recording, strategy alignment, portfolio management.
          It also provides an intuitive dashboard which presents the key information and project changes, as well as smart notifications that help simplify the workflow.

          <h2>Iteration 1 - Starting From Scratch</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Challenge</b><br>
            Redesign the application architecture and fit the information in a modern and intuitive user interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Solution</b><br>
            Starting from "scratch", I distilled the most important information sections and rephrased them in to different pods that enable flexibility on different platforms and screen sizes.
            I also designed a dashboard that consists of succinct data from different tabs.
            To improve the UI style and create a sense of 'familiarity', I followed the Adobe internal design guidelines.
          </p>
          <img src="image/adobe/i1.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            <b>Key Takeaways</b><br>
            <ul style="margin-top:-10px;">
              <li>Only present the essential information on the dashboard.</li>
              <li>Do not try to guide users to perform two tasks on the same page.</li>
              <li>Use only one and clear navigation.</li>

          <h2>Iteration 2 - Handling Tables</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Challenge</b><br>
            Design clean and intuitive tables.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Solution</b><br>
            However, the information presentation in iteration 1 is still to overwhelming and patterns used are not consistent.
            So the second iteration focused on understanding what is really important to users and only keep the relevant data on the dashboard and front page.
            In addition, I also explored the interaction patterns used in table design such as 'drawers', 'modal screen', and 'breadcrums'.
          </p>
          <img src="image/adobe/i2.png" alt="" />

            <b>Key Takeaways</b><br>
            <ul style="margin-top:-10px;">
              <li>Put the most important information at the beginning or end of the table columns.</li>
              <li>Utilize the patterns that people are familiar with and keep them consistent.</li>
              <li>Design "bonus" interactions (shortcuts) to meet the needs of proficient users.</li>

            <b>Challenge</b><br>
            Create forms that are easy to edit and catch the key information.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Solution</b><br>
            I iterated through different layout by experimenting with margins, font size, paddings, and button positions.
            In addition, I also learnt how to choose button styles more wisely (e.g. using CTA buttons only once for proceeding to next steps, group action buttons together as a toolbar).

            Redesign the tables to make them functional.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Solution</b><br>
            After sharing my design with my team and potential users, I got valuable feedback on how users would normally use the data.
            In this iteration, I looked at tables again to explore the four key aspects:
            <ul style="margin-top:-10px;">
              <li>How to present data given a limited table width</li>
              <li>How to arrange columns and decide which comes first</li>
              <li>How to filter the data to enable customization</li>
              <li>How to design editing functionality inside a table</li>

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Solution</b><br>
            I started to look at the 'automated workflow' and how the interface would look like for different personas.
            I created a user workflow cycle engaging all three primary personas and bridged the gap between them by designing micro-interactions like useful feedback and smart notifications.

            <b>Solution</b><br>
            This is the last round during my internship.
            I refined the icon styles, unified margins/paddings, adjusted color palette to create pixel-perfect hi-fidelity mockups.
            I also created a working prototype to help my team present the new solution to stakeholders.
